1. Takahashi 2010 shows a mass density spike (in one-day averages) following storm onset for 1989-1991 for GOES 6 and 7  We confirm for 3 of 4 satellites from 1981-1991 in one-hour averaged data that mass density tends to increase after storm onset (My Fig 21-22).  We find a smaller mass density spike for largely negative Dst events from 1989-1991 for GOES 6 for one-day averages (His Fig11, my Fig 3a).  However, when only storms during high F10.7 are considered, the spike is larger and closer to that found by Takahashi.  The difference between mass density in high F10.7 events and low F10.7 events increases as the threshold for a Dst "event" gets more negative for all satellites except GOES 7.

2. The median mass density in 5 hours after and including storm onset is best correlated with the median value of F10.7 in the 5 hours preceeding the hour of storm onset (ccs ~ 0.4 for GOES 2,6,7, weak for GOES 5).  Solar wind measurements of V, Bz, and ion number density have a weak correlation that is independent of the F10.7 correlation.  Same for Dst.  The weak, but statitically significant trend independent of F10.7 is for increasing \rho_{eq} to be associated with higher rho_{sw}, higher V_{sw}, and more positive B_z (Scatter plot indicates positive Bz, F10.7 and Bz linear plot indicates neutral/negative)

3. Takahashi 2006 shows a Kp dependence on average ion mass for 3h, 1.5d, and 3d averages for all wave events (that are used to compute average ion mass) [Figure 10].  A dependence on M appears in 1.5d and 3d averages.  We show that long time scale averages of mass density do correlate better with longer time scale variables (e.g. Kp, F10.7) due to the large short time scale fluctations in mass density.

4. We found multiple data biases that may or may not impact results (untested). AE values exist predominantly at post-noon UT hours, as well as having larger values post-noon. Median mass density peaks around 6 LT, and 23 MLT. Satellites have oddities (GOES 7 shows no mass density spike for high F10.7, and GOES 5 shows it weakly. GOES 5 log(mass density) does not correlate well with F10.7 when for all other satellites it does.) All data have issues with availability, and corresponding plots are included where appropriate and relevant.
