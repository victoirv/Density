1. Takahashi 2006 shows a Kp dependence on average ion mass for 3h, 1.5d, and 3d averages for all wave events (that are used to compute average ion mass) [Figure 10].  A dependence on M appears in 1.5d and 3d averages.  We show ...

2. Takahashi 2010 shows a mass density spike (in one-day averages) following storm onset for 1989-1991 for GOES ??  We confirm for 3 of 4 satellites in one-hour averaged data that mass density tends to increase after storm onset (My Fig 21-22).  We find that a smaller spike for 1989-1991 for GOES ?? for one-day averages (His Fig11, my Fig 3a).  However, when only storms during high F10.7 are considered, the spike is closer to that found by Takahashi.  The difference between mass density in high F10.7 events and low F10.7 events increases as the threshold for a Dst "event" gets more negative for all satellites except GOES 7.

3. The median mass density in 4 hours after storm onset is best correlated with the median value of F10.7 in the 5 hours including and preceeding the hour of storm onset (ccs ~ 0.4 for all satellites).  Solar wind measurements of V, Bz, and ion number density have a weak correlation that is independent of the F10.7 correlation.  Same for Dst.  The weak, but statitically significant trend independent of F10.7 is for increasing \rho_{eq} to be associated with higher rho_{sw}, ... V_{sw}, and ... B_z.

4. We found multiple data biases that may or may not impact results (untested). AE values exist predominantly at post-noon UT hours, as well as having larger values post-noon. Median mass density peaks around 6 LT, and 23 MLT. All data have issues with availability, and corresponding plots are included where appropriate and relevant.
