%%  AGU's sample and template file

   % This document demonstrates how to use commands 
   % described in the aguguide.tex user manual.  Most 
   % instructions and explanations are commented out; 
   % thus they will not appear if you LaTeX this file 
   % and view it as a sample document.

   % You may use this file as a template for your
   % camera-ready LaTeX document by replacing the
   % sample text with your own text and deleting 
   % any extraneous commands.

   % Note that this sample was created using the jgrga.sty
   % and therefore the lines will break accurately when
   % that style file is used.  If one of the other style 
   % files is used in the \documentstyle command, the
   % linebreaks may occur in odd places.  Use \linebreak
   % or \\ commands or \- (optional hyphen) commands to 
   % correct this as needed.

%% ------------------------------------------------------ %%

   % The first item in a LaTeX file must be a \documentstyle
   % command to declare the overall style of the paper.  The
   % \documentstyle lines that are relevant for AGU's LaTeX 
   % style files are shown; all but one are commented out so 
   % that the file can be processed.

   % \documentstyle[12pt,agums]{article}
     % This substyle creates double-spaced wide-margined 
    % manuscripts.  Use it to create copy to submit 
        % to AGU editors for first-time review.

   % \documentstyle[agupp]{article}
      % This substyle creates two-column preprints 
   % (i.e., for distribution to colleagues; do not 
        % submit two-column manuscripts to AGU).

   % \documentstyle[rtjga]{article}
     % This substyle creates single-column camera-ready 
     % manuscripts for Russian translation journals.

   % \documentstyle[grlga]{article}
      % This substyle creates single-column camera-ready 
     % manuscripts for Geophysical Research Letters.

   % \documentstyle[radga]{article}
      % This substyle creates single-column camera-ready 
     % manuscripts for Radio Science.

   % \documentstyle[tecga]{article}
     % This substyle creates single-column camera-ready 
     % manuscripts for Tectonics.

\documentstyle[jgrga]{article}
      % This substyle creates single-column camera-ready

\section{Introduction}

   A focal problem today in the dynamics of globular 
clusters is core collapse.  It has been predicted by 
theory for decades [\markcite{{Baker et al.,} 1977;}
\markcite{{\it Barbour and Major,} 1977}; 
\markcite{{\it Bell,} 1972}], but observation has been 
less alert to the phenomenon.  For many years the 
central brightness peak in M15 [\markcite{{\it Brosche 
and Sunderman,} 1977}; \markcite{{\it Yamazaki,} 1978}] 
seemed a unique anomaly.

\section{Ragged Right Level 1 Head Longer Than One 
Line With a Flush Left Wraparound}

Then \markcite{{\it Higgins} [1968]} suggested 
a central peak in NGC 6397, and limited photographic 
surveys of \markcite{{\it Degges and Smith} [1977]} and 
\markcite{{\it Golitsyn and Mokhov} [1978]} were 
conducted, including NGC 6624, whose sharp center had 
often been noted [e.g., \markcite{{\it Namias,} 1974]}.

\section{Ragged Right Level 1 Head Longer Than One Line 
With a Flush Left Wraparound Line and 
$\protect \boldmath Italic $ Text}
   All our observations were short direct exposures with CCDs.  
At Central Observatory we used a TI 500$\times$500 chip and a 
GEC 575$\times$385 on the 1-m Nickel reflector.  The only 
filter available at Central was red.  At CTIO we used a GEC 
575$\times$385 with $B, V,$ and $R$ filters and an RCA 
512$\times$320 with $U, B, V, R,$ and $I$ filters on the 
1.5-m reflector.  

   The CCD images are unfortunately not always suitable 
for very poor clusters or for clusters with large cores, 
as seen in section \ref{text}.  

A number of star count profiles [\markcite{{\it Kennealy 
and Caledonia,} 1979}] as well as photoelectric profiles 
[\markcite{{\it McMullen,} 1978}] were reviewed.  In a 
few cases we judged normality by eye estimates on one 
of the Sky Surveys.

\section{A Level One Head}\label{text}
   It has been realized that helicity amplitudes provide
a convenient means for diagram evaluations.  These
amplitude level techniques are particularly convenient
for calculations involving many diagrams, where the
usual trace techniques for the amplitude squared become
unwieldy.  Our calculations use helicity techniques
[\markcite{{\it Hagiwara and Zeppenfeld,} 1986}]; 
we summarize below.

\subsection{Formalism}
A three-level amplitude in $ e^+e^-$ collisions can be
expressed in terms of fermion strings of the form
\begin{equation}
   \bar v(p_2,\sigma_2)P_{-\tau}\not\!a_1\not\!a_2
   \cdots\not\!a_nu(p_1,\sigma_1)\;,
\end{equation}
where $p$ and $\sigma$ label the initial $e^{\pm}$
four momenta and helicities $(\sigma = \pm 1)$,
$\not\!a_i=a^\mu_i\gamma_\nu$, and 
$P_\tau=\frac{1}{2}(1+\tau\gamma_5)$ is a chirality 
projection operator $(\tau = \pm1)$.  The $a^\mu_i$ 
may be formed from particle four momenta, gauge boson
polarization vectors, or fermion strings with an 
uncontracted Lorentz index associated with final state 
fermions.

\subsection{A Level Two Head}
In the chiral representation the $\gamma$ matrices 
are expressed in terms of $2\times 2$ Pauli matrices 
$\sigma$ and the unit matrix 1 as

%% ------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------ %%

%%%% Single-line equations are centered.  For multiline 
   % equations, break each line at a sign of operation 
   % (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation 
   % on the new line.  Indent second and subsequent lines 
   % to align with the first character following the equal 
   % sign on the first line.  If the left side of the 
   % equation is longer than one-third of the line, 
   % subsequent lines should be indented the same amount 
   % as a text paragraph indent (0.38cm, 0.15").  Set the 
   % equation number flush right on the last line of the 
   % equation with at least 4 mm (5/16 inch, 1 pica) of 
   % space between the equation and the equation number;  
   % if there is not enough room, set the number flush 
   % right on a separate line immediately following the
   % equation.  If you have two equations with the same 
   % equation number, set them over three lines of type, 
   % with the equation number appearing flush right and 
   % in parentheses on the second line.  

%%%% To create multi-line equations, use the
   % \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
   % to break equations into two or more lines, as
   % demonstrated below.  Use an \hspace{} command to
   % insert horizontal space into your LaTeX document.
   % Place an appropriate unit of measure between the
   % curly braces; you may have to experiment to achieve
   % the correct amount of space.  LaTeX accepts several
   % units of measurement (cm, in, etc.); you may use
   % whichever unit you prefer.

\begin{eqnarray}
   x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta + 
        (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta \\ 
   y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta + 
        (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%%%% You may change equation numbering by resetting 
   % the equation counter or by explicitly numbering 
   % an equation.
   % 
   % To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
   % (with the desired number between the brackets) 
   % after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
   % command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
   % the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
   % any equations appearing later in the manuscript 
   % according to the equation counter.
   %
   % To reset the equation counter, place the following 
   % command in front of your equation(s).

\setcounter{equation}{0}

   % Set the equation counter to 0 if the next 
   % number needed is 1, or set it to 7 if the 
   % next number needed is 8, etc.
   %
   % The \setcounter{equation} command does affect 
   % equations appearing later in the manuscript.

%%%% If you have a multi-line equation that needs only
   % one equation number, use a \nonumber command in 
   % front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
   % equations above and below.

%%%% To add letters after equation numbers, place your 
   % equation or eqnarray within a \begin{mathletters} 
   % and \end{mathletters} environment.  This environment
   % can enclose several equations:

\begin{mathletters}
   \begin{eqnarray}
      \gamma^\mu & = & \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 
      \sigma^\mu_+ \\ 
      \sigma^\mu_- & 0 \end{array} \right), 
      \;\gamma = \left( \begin{array}{cc} 
      \! \! -1 & \! \! 0 \\ \! \! 0 & \! \! 1  
      \end{array} \right), \\ & & \nonumber \\
      \sigma^\mu_{\pm} & = & ({\bf 1} ,\pm \sigma),
   \end{eqnarray}
giving 
   \begin{eqnarray}
      \not\!a= \left(\begin{array}{cc}0 & 
      (\not\!a)_+\\(\not\!a)_- & 
      0\end{array}\right), 
      \;(\not\!a)_\pm=a_\mu\sigma^\mu_\pm\;,

\section{Floating Material}
Consider a task that computes profile parameters for 
a modified Lorentzian of the following form:
\begin{equation}
   I = \frac{1}{1 + d_{1}^{P (1 + d_{2} )}}, 
\end{equation}
where
\begin{mathletters}
\begin{eqnarray}
   d_{1} = \frac{3}{4} \sqrt{ \left( \begin{array}{c} 
   \frac{x_{1}}{R_{\rm maj}} 
   \end{array} \right) ^{2} + \left( 
   \begin{array}{c} \frac{y_{1}}{R_{\rm min}} 
   \end{array} \right) ^{2} } \\
   d_{2} = \case{3}{4} \sqrt{ \left( 
   \begin{array}{c} \frac{x_{1}}{P R_{\rm maj}}
   \end{array} \right) ^{2} + \left( 
   \begin{array}{c} \case{y_{1}}{P R_{\rm min}} 
   \end{array} \right) ^{2}.}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{mathletters}
In these expressions, $x_{0}$, $y_{0}$ is the star 
center, and $\Theta$ is the angle with the $x$ axis.
Results of this task are shown in

%
%%  CALLOUTS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------ %%
   %
\callout{Table~\ref{tbl-1}}
and
\callout{Table~2}.
   %
   % The first time a table, figure, or plate is 
   % mentioned in a manuscript, AGU asks that it 
   % be called out (i.e., identified in the right 
   % margin of the camera-ready copy).
   %
   % Enclose the first occurrence of a table, figure,
   % or plate within a \callout{} command.  Text within
   % this command will appear in your manuscript text 
   % and will also appear in a box in the right margin 
   % of your manuscript.  Make sure all callouts appear
   % in numerical sequence (i.e., Table 1, Table 2, etc.)
   %
   % You may use \ref{} commands within callout commands,
   % as shown above.
   %
It is not clear how these sorts of analyses may affect 
determination of $M_{\sun}$ and $M_{\earth}$, but the 
assumption is that the alternate results should be less 
than 90\deg\ out of phase with previous values.  We have 
no observations of \ion{Ca}{2}.

%%  APPENDICES
%%
%%

\appendix
\section{Appendix A: Your Title}

   % If you have several appendix sections, lettering in
   % the appendix header should match the above example.
   % If there is only one appendix, lettering should not
   % appear in the header: \section{Appendix: Your Title}.

   % Important:  The \appendix command causes all 
   % following equations to use a lettered number
   % (for instance, A1).  This is to distinguish 
   % appendix equations from equations that appear 
   % in the main body of the manuscript.

   % Appendix tables must be manually labeled.
   % If your manuscript contains tables that 
   % accompany an appendix section, you must use 
   % \tablenum{} commands and label the table(s) 
   % accordingly.  (If there is one appendix section 
   % and one table, the table number will be 
   % \tablenum{A1}; if there are two appendix 
   % sections, tables appearing in the second 
   % section will begin with \tablenum{B1}, etc.)

Consider a task that computes profile parameters for 
a modified Lorentzian of the form
\begin{equation}
   I = \frac{1}{1 + d_{1}^{P (1 + d_{2} )}}, 
\end{equation}
where
\begin{mathletters}
\begin{equation}
   d_{1} = \frac{3}{4} \sqrt{ \left( \begin{array}{c} 
           \frac{x_{1}}{R_{maj}} 
   \end{array} \right) ^{2} + \left( \begin{array}{c} 
           \frac{y_{1}}{R_{min}} 
   \end{array} \right) ^{2} } 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
   d_{2} = \case{3}{4} \sqrt{ \left( \begin{array}{c} 
           \frac{x_{1}}{P R_{maj}}
   \end{array} \right) ^{2} + \left( \begin{array}{c} 
           \case{y_{1}}{P R_{min}} 
   \end{array} \right) ^{2} }  
\end{equation}
which leaves us with the conclusion that
\begin{equation}
   x_{1} = (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta 
   + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
   y_{1} = -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta 
   + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta. 
\end{equation}
\end{mathletters}

\section{Appendix B: One Last Equation}
For completeness, here is one last equation
\setcounter{equation}{0}  
\begin{equation}
e = mc^2.
\end{equation}
Notice how the equation numbering and lettering 
is reset when a new appendix section is added.

%%  NOTATION TABLES (if any)

%% ------------------------------------------------------ %%
   %
   % If your manuscript contains notation tables, use a 
   % Level 1 head for the word "Notation" and use a 
   % tabular environment without any rules for the 
   % notation information, as shown below.
   %
   % If you numbered your sections, place a 
   % \setcounter{secnumdepth}{0} in front of 
   % the Notation section head, so it will 
   % appear flush left and without numbers.
   %
   % Set the symbol columns flush right and the 
   % definition column flush left.  You will probably
   % need to adjust the {rp{17.5pc} spacing to create
   % appropriate widths for your notation columns.

\newpage

   % An alternate way of handling references is to use 
   % "\cite" and "\bibitem" commands to call out citations,
   % and then use LaTeX's "thebibliography" environment 
   % for the reference list.  Please note that the 
   % \begin{thebibliography}{} command is followed by a 
   % null argument {} (see the example below).
   %
   % Each reference has a \bibitem command to define 
   % the citation format and the symbolic tag, as well 
   % as a \reference command which sets up formatting 
   % parameters for the reference list itself.  Authors 
   % choose what markup appears in the text, but it must 
   % match the tags used with the corresponding \bibitem 
   % command.  (For example, [\cite{can95}; \cite{kur94};
   % \cite{hag86}] or [\cite{aur92}].)
   %
   % A drawback to using this system is that 
   % references will be typeset exactly as they 
   % appear in the \bibitem command.  Thus the 
   % \cite-\bibitem system is unable to produce 
   % format such as {\it Kurtz and King} [1994].  
   % If your manuscript ever uses this format you 
   % should probably use the \markcite commands.

   % The following examples are commented out so 
   % the file will LaTeX properly.

%%  FIGURE CAPTIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------ %%

   % Set figure captions between the curly brackets in the 
   % \caption command.  Each figure caption must have a 
   % \begin{figure} before and an \end{figure} after, 
   % as shown.  Several captions may be printed per page, 
   % as long as there is sufficient room to cut between 
   % the captions.  
   %
   % It may be necessary to use \clearpage commands 
   % between a long series of captions, since a large 
   % number of captions can cause LaTeX's memory buffer 
   % to overload and crash.  
   %
   % AGU asks authors to submit two sets of captions; 
   % one set for single column and one set for double 
   % column figures.  You must input the first set of 
   % captions, but AGU's LaTeX style files will 
   % automatically generate the second set of captions.  
   % Both sets of captions will print at the correct 
   % single- and double-column widths for your journal 
   % (these widths change depending on the document style 
   % you choose).
   %
   % The \figurewidth commands do not affect the second
   % set of figure captions.  The second set of captions
   % will always mirror the figure numbers of the first
   % set of captions.
   %
   % The wide figure captions will likely cause
   % "overfull hbox" error messages to appear when 
   % you LaTeX your file: please ignore these.
   %
   % Be aware that figure width and figure numbering 
   % commands may affect following plate captions, 
   % and vice versa.
   %
   % Caption lines may be broken by using a \protect 
   % command in front of a \linebreak command:
   % \protect\linebreak (this will maintain justification).

\begin{figure}
        \caption{We use the \LaTeX\ {\tt figure} environment 
        to set figure captions.  Figure captions consist of 
        a paragraph containing several sentences or phrases.}
\end{figure}

       \begin{figure}
\figurenum{17c}
   % The \figurenum command allows you to explicitly 
      % number your figure captions.  Letters or symbols 
     % may also be included.  This command *does* affect 
    % LaTeX's figure counter (so the next figure number 
    % would be 3 instead of 2, if there was no explicit
     % \figurenum or \setcounter command).
   % 
\figurewidth{13pc}
    % The \figurewidth command, when used inside 
   % a figure environment, sets the width of the 
  % first set of that particular caption to the 
        % specified width (shown is 13 picas).  
  % 
      \caption{AGU asks authors to submit two sets

        always print at the correct double-column width 
        for your journal.  The first caption for this 
        figure will print at a width of 13 picas.}
      \end{figure}


\setcounter{figure}{0}  
        % (set this to 0 if the next number is 1, etc.)
     % To reset the figure counter, place this command

\figurewidth{25pc}
     % The \figurewidth command, when placed in front of a

       % to the specified width (shown is 25 picas).

   \begin{figure}

%%  PLATE CAPTIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------ %%

   % Plate captions are similar to figure captions, 
   % but they use \platenum{}, \platewidth, and 
   % \setcounter{plate}{} commands.  Again, AGU 
   % asks authors to submit two sets of captions;

   % double column plate widths.
   %
   % It may be necessary to use \clearpage commands

 % included.  This command *does* affect LaTeX's plate 
  % counter (so the next plate number would be 3, not 2).
 % 
\platewidth{41pc}
     % The \platewidth{} command, when used inside a plate 
  % environment, sets the width of that particular caption 
       % to the specified width (shown is 41 picas).
   % 
      \caption{Use a \LaTeX\ {\tt plate} environment

%%  TABLES
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------ %%

%%%% Table Page Breaks
   %
   % Tables should be submitted one or two to a page 
   % following the main body of the text.  (Planotables 
   % automatically begin on a new page for formatting 
   % reasons.)  Use \clearpage commands to force page 
   % breaks as needed.  Include a \clearpage command 
   % after the last table so it is forced onto its own 
   % page as well.

%%%% Table Rules
   %
   % AGU table style allows no vertical rules.  The 
   % required horizontal rules are created automatically
   % by the \startdata command.  If you must include 
   % other rules, use a \tableline command (not an 
   % \hline command).

%%%% Table Footnotes
   % 
   % Some column headings require special annotation, 
   % i.e., table footnotes.  These are marked and tagged 
   % with \tablenotemark{tag}.  The \tablenotemark commands
   % may be placed on individual data entries as well, 
   % but try to keep them to a minimum.  Accompanying text 
   % appears in \tablenotetext{tag}{TEXT} commands; the 
   % \tablenotetext "tag" must match the "tag" in the 
   % appropriate \tablenotemark command.
   % 
   % Place short table notes in \tablenotetext{\null}{TEXT} 
   % commands, with a \null argument as the tag.  Longer 
   % notes may be placed in a \tablecomment{TEXT} command.  
   % Lists of table references should use this format:
   % \tablecomment{References:  Names of your references.}  
   % There are examples of these in the tables below.

%%%% Column Headers
   % 
   % The \colhead{} command automatically creates centered 
   % column headers, in accordance with AGU style.  Use this
   % command in place of the usual \multicolumn{} command.  
   % If you prefer to use multicolumn{}, or if you have a 
   % more complicated table, AGU's style files will still 
   % accept that coding.  It is not recommended that both 
   % the \colhead{} and \multicolumn{} commands be used in 
   % the same table.  Examples of both styles are included.

%%%% Table Captions 
   %
   % Captions should contain only the caption text.  
   % The "Table #." identification is generated 
   % automatically.  If you need to change the table 
   % number, see the section on table numbers, below.
   %   
   % Use \tablecaption{} commands with planotables and
   % \caption{} commands with tabular tables.

%%%% Tabular Tables
   %
   % It is possible to use a "tabular" environment to 
   % create tables.  The tabular environment should be 
   % embedded within a table environment (which is needed 
   % for automatic numbering and caption generation).  
   % See the last table for an example.

%%%% Planotables
   %
   % Planotables have several capabilities (above and 
   % beyond LaTeX's tabular environment) that facilitate
   % the formatting of tables.  For instance, it is 
   % possible to break long planotables across pages, 
   % and while tabular tables print at an automatic width,
   % authors may choose a specific planotable width.
   % See the aguguide.tex and samples below for more 
   % information.



%%%% Numbering Tables
   % 
   % If you must create a particular table number, or if 
   % you need a letter before or after a table number,
   % use a \tablenum{} command, with the desired text
   % between the curly brackets.  Several examples are
   % shown below.  A \tablenum command will affect any
   % following table numbers.

%%%% Setting Planotable Widths
   %
   % Use \tablewidth{} commands to set the width of 
   % your planotables.  See the aguguide.tex or the
   % Table section in your General Instructions to
   % choose an appropriate size for your table.
