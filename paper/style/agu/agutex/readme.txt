              file to enter the PS font names found on your system. Look
              at the top of the file for info on how to easily change
              the font names.

              commands for inserting .eps files; landscape tables and
              figures, in a single column and in a full page. Also 
              shows \begin{filecontents*}{<filename>} in use, a method
              of inserting .eps or .bbl files into your .tex file. These
