%   You may not need this file unless you have 
%   a very old version of LaTeX 2.09.
%
%   This file keeps old versions of LaTeX 2.09 
%   from becoming confused with \reset@font and 
%   thus crashing at every undefined label or 
%   citation.  
%
%   If you do need to include this file, 
%   type \input{update.tex} in front of your 
%   \begin{document} command in your *.tex
%   file and then continue as you would ordinarily.
