\begin{abstract}
This paper compares various magnetosphere conditions around the onset of geomagnetic events. It confirms results from previous papers that a sudden drop in $D_{st}$ correlates with a spike in equatorial mass density under certain conditions, while adding a level of depth and specification to the applicability of their results. It compares data at 1-hour averages to data at 1-day averages to examine if the trend holds at varying time scales and finds that it does, so long as the data is pre-processed to linearly remove a large time scale $F_{10.7}$ dependence. 
By then looking at an hourly average of parameters from 24 hours before event onset to 48 hours after, short timescale trends can be discerned.

\section{Introduction}
% try is colloqual.  
% hope is colloqual.
% intends is colloqual.

\cite{Takahashi2006}, show how trends in storm dependence on mass/density only appear in longer timescales. Looking at $K_p$ vs mass ($amu$) in the range of 6 to 7 $R_E$, a trend shows up in the 1.5 day averages that doesn't appear in the 3 hour averages.

\cite{Denton2006} show how $D_{st}$ affects the distribution of plasma density along different magnetic latitudes, and specifically along the same field lines as looked at in later papers (6-8$R_E$). Though this shows that the trends for density may differ between field lines, it's mentioned mostly as a point for future research as the data used in this paper is already adjusted for one field line, as described by \cite{Takahashi2010}.

\cite{Yao2008} looks at the differences in how $D_{st}$ correlates with number density for different ions in different regions (ring current and plasma sheet), but still finds a general correlation during each of the four storms selected.

\cite{Takahashi2010} state that spikes in the Disturbance Storm Time ($D_{st}$) index coincide with with significant changes in $\rho_{eq}$ at an L-shell of 6.8$R_E$. For five storms over a 20 day period two had $\rho_{eq}$ spikes after the $D_{st}$ drop, two had $\rho_{eq}$ spikes before the drop, and one showed little change in $\rho_{eq}$. They then show an epoch analysis where $\rho_{eq}$ is seen to spike the day of a $D_{st}$ drop, using a daily average of 30 minute $\rho_{eq}$ and one hour $D_{st}$ measurements. 

%\cite{Lavraud2006} show that storms preceded by a northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) tend to have higher plasma density than those preceded by a southward IMF, and suggest an increased geoeffectiveness from a northward IMF and dense plasma sheet.

%\cite{Tsurutani1997} show how the density of a corotating interaction region (CIR) shows strong preconditioning for a drop in $D_{st}$ and spike in magnetic field intensity. Assuming a reasonable amount of coupling between that region's density and the plasmaspheric density, this result could be relatable to others focusing on the plasmasphere. 



\section{Data Preparation}

The parameters $\rho_{eq}$ and $F_{10.7}$ used in this work are from the dataset associated with \cite{Denton}, with data available from 1980-1991; all other parameters are from \cite{Reconstruction} over the time range of 1972-2013, which are on a 1-hour time grid. $\rho_{eq}$ is the inferred mass density based on the 3rd harmonic frequency of magnetic field measurements.  The smallest cadence for $\rho_{eq}$ values is 10 minutes.  To compute an hourly average over the same time range as the solar wind parameters, the median of all values in a given hourly range was used.  Fill values were used for hours when no measurements were available.  In cases where $\rho_{eq}$ was available from multiple Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) satellites at the same time in the \cite{Denton} dataset, the value from GOES 7 was selected to avoid overlapping data points.  In the dataset, measurements from GOES 7 had the longest time span of coverage.  An overview of the data is given in Figure~\ref{AllData}.

% How does GOES 7 only effect result.

In this work events defined to occur when $D_{st}$ or $\rho_{eq}$ crosses a threshold value, as indicated in by horizontal dashed lines in the respective panels of Figure~\ref{AllData}.  In finding events, all fill values were replaced with linearly interpolated values.  Figure \ref{AllData} shows the values of $B_z$, $V_{SW}$, $D_{st}$, $F_{10.7}$, and Mass Density for the duration of the dataset. 

% Though this may skew the onset time slightly, it's thought to be less skewed than trying to determine start and end times with the NaNs in place. This interpolation was only used for determining storm times, and not for any analysis.
% If you say this, you need to do an experiement.  A review will say ``seems like it is an easy statement to check.  Why didn't you?''

\section{Results}
Figure \ref{AllData} shows values of solar wind averages and mass density used in this study. We will briefly compare our results to other published results to verify our methods and handling of data. 

\subsection{Previous Results}

Figure~\ref{ccplot:a} shows the long-term trends of $log(\rho_{eq})$ and $F_{10.7}$ by computing the median in 27-day windows using all non--fill hourly values.  A scatter plot of these two lines is shown in Figure~\ref{ccplot:b}.  The linear correlation is found to be $0.87$.  In comparison, \cite{Takahashi2010} found a correlation coefficient of $0.94$ using measurements from all satellites in the time interval of 1980 to 1992.

The correlation seen between 27-day averages $log(\rho_{eq\_27d})$ and $F_{10.7\_27d}$ isn't quite as good in this data as in \cite{Takahashi2010}, but shows the same trend as seen in Figure \ref{ccplot}.

Figure \ref{DailyAverages} show that the trends observed by \cite{Takahashi2010} for one day averages only seems to hold true for the one-day averaged data. Namely that a drop in median daily $D_{st}$ between 1989 and 1991 coincides with a significant spike in $\rho_{eq}$. 

\subsection{D$_{st}$ Events}
Two event indicators are looked at in this study. The first is looking for a drop in DST below the threshold of $-40nT$ specified in \cite{Takahashi2010}, dubbed the "onset", and then considering the timeframe an event until $D_{st}$ passes back above the $-40nT$ threshold. This method finds 669 such periods between May 1983 and August 1991 with an average duration of 9 hours and a median duration of 3 hours. Figure \ref{Storms} shows the average values of all events over a window of 24 hours before onset and 48 hours after. Figure \ref{Storms}a shows events selected by looking for event onsets where $D_{st}$ crossed a threshold of $-40nT$. The dashed red lines indicate plus and minus one standard deviation of values from all events that went into the average. The final plot in the stack shows both $\rho_{eq}$ and a bar plot of how many valid data points went into the $\rho_{eq}$ average. Since $\rho_{eq}$ comes from a sparser dataset, it has less valid points contributing to the averages than the other parameters in the stack. A subset of longer duration events will be looked at later. 

This figure shows a definite spike in the $Z$ component of the magnetic field, as well as the defined drop in $DST$, but no obvious change in mass density at an hourly timescale. This points to an issue with only looking at long-timescale trends between density and $D_{st}$, and allows for the possibility that other factors are influencing the long term correlation since there's no obvious connection on a short timescale. One possibility is that, as suggested in \cite{Takahashi2010}, $F_{10.7}$ plays a significant role in driving long term density values which biases the long term correlation of density and $D_{st}$.

\subsection{Mass Density Events}
Figure \ref{Storms}b shows this same algorithm, but looking for a rise in mass density over a value of 40$g/cm^3$. This results in 130 events with a mean duration of 32 hours and a median duration of 17 hours, marked in red on the left figure.

This shows that when using all data for mass density derived events, almost no significant changes can be seen around event onset.



\section{More specific events}
It's hypothesized that progressively picking more specific event criteria will allow for the possibility of more significant results, at the expense of more bias in the selection process and potentially less overall usefulness of the results. That said, the predictability of extreme events is of definite interest, so an attempt has been made to find some reproducible method of prediction. Looking at events that last longer than 12 hours and events with an onset threshhold greater than $70g/cm^3$ results in the left and right sides of Figure \ref{Mspec} respectively.



Neither of these seem to indicate anything too significant, so looking at $D_{st}$ events instead to look for something that causes a significant change in Mass Density results in Figure \ref{Dspec}. This shows that by either looking only at $D_{st}$ events that last longer than an hour (left) or at events where the onset condition is $D_{st}<-80nT$, a spike in mass density is seen, but also a definite lack of data availability to the point where that spike may be coming from less than five of the total 143 events. 



Unfortunately there are no events in this time frame that are longer than 12 hours with $D_{st}$ minima lower than $-80nT$ that have existing mass density data around onset, so an analysis of this particular relationship can't be made.

\subsection{Change in $\rho_{eq}$}
If instead of looking for events based on a threshold of $\rho_{eq}$, we instead look for a certain amount of change in $\rho_{eq}$ as the basis for event onset, we get Figure \ref{rhochange}.



Both raw change and percent change were done in case of bias towards high or low $\rho_{eq}$ periods, respectively. This shows a distinct lack of correlation in either case to a change in $D_{st}$. The percent change in $\rho_{eq}$ does, however, seem to be preconditioned by changes in $B_z$ and $F_{10.7}$.



\section{F10.7 dependence}
In an effort to analyze the dependence of $\rho_{eq}$ on $F_{10.7}$, a few tests were performed. \cite{Takahashi2010} mention a strong correlation between the two. The long term correlation could be a bias for $D_{st}$'s effects, so a linear model was created, recreating mass density purely from $F_{10.7}$ in the form of $\rho_{eq}(t)=A*F_{10.7}(t)$. This re-created $\rho_{eq}$ shows around a 45\% correlation with the actual $\rho_{eq}$, suggesting a strong influence, while doing the same procedure with $DST$ shows only a 20-25\% correlation. 

Taking this re-created data set and subtracting it from the original should remove the $F_{10.7}$ dependence from the data, and allow for a less biased analysis of the relationship between $D_{st}$ and $\rho_{eq}$. Figure \ref{nof107} shows the stack plot for the reduced $F_{10.7}$, where a more distinct peak after event onset can be seen. It also shows what that removed trend looks like, of the form $\rho_{eq}-\rho_{eq,F_{10.7}}$.

\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Bias}
While attempting to reproduce Figure 11 from \cite{Takahashi2010}, an ambiguity in data-handling was found. It is unknown how they got from hourly $\rho_{eq}$ to daily medians, whether in one step or two steps, and whether the hourly medians are an hour ahead of each hour grid point, or a median of points a half hour to either side, so attempts were made to reproduce all possibilities and compare in order to find a data-handling method with the least bias. These attempts are shown in Figure \ref{blockmedian}. This also shows the effect of only considering events with a minimum before noon. All show a similar spike in $\rho_{eq}$ at the time of $D_{st}$ minimum, though none quite reproduce the exact values seen in \cite{Takahashi2010}. Figure \ref{allstorms} shows where the median falls for all of the found events during that period, as a sanity check for why the prior work would get median values nearing $30 amu/cm^3$. Both authors of this paper conducted independent trials to confirm that the data and analysis don't quite yield the results of Figure 11 in \cite{Takahashi2010} with the processes described in that paper, but the same general trend is still seen. 

To check for potential bias in the data as used by our analysis, we checked how the data availability varied with hour, shown in Figure \ref{nanperhour}. We also looked at how storm conditions affected data availability. Both a two sample t-test for difference in means and a Wilcoxon rank sum test showed significance at the 1\% level that $D_{st}$ during periods with available data was of a different distribution than $D_{st}$ during periods missing data. When testing for other significant $D_{st}$ differences, the Wilcoxon test was significant while the t-test was not in pre-noon vs post-noon distributions, as well as $\rho_{eq}>40$ vs $\rho_{eq}<40$ distributions indicating perhaps an increase in variability without an increase in mean.

While the GOES Satellites tend to keep an average geostationary distance of around $L=6.8R_E$ shown in \cite{Takahashi2010}, the actual plasmapause location varies significantly, as shown in \cite{OBrien2003}. This means that during periods of large $D_{st}$ the plasmapause may be far from the point of measurement of $\rho_{eq}$ creating a discord in the correlation. \cite{Gallagher2000} provides a model for $\rho_{eq}$ at a range of L-shells and a brief discussion of the elemental contributions.
